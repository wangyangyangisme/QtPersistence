Installing QtPersistence from Source
==============================================================================

QtPersistence uses CMake to build the source code. For most systems, the
following steps will work just fine. These steps assume that you're in the
toplevel source directory (the same directory this file is in) already.

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install

It is possible for CMake to report that it's found a few of the external
libraries successfully. If QtPersistance fails to compile, but CMake reports
that it found everything it needed, doing the following might help:

- For GTest, set GTEST_ROOT to the location of the GTest install prefix.
  As an example, if the GTest library is found in /opt/local/lib, then add
  "-DGTEST_ROOT=/opt/local" to the cmake command line.

- For GMock, set GMOCK_ROOT to the location of the GMock install prefix.
  As an example, if the GMock library is found in /opt/local/lib, then add
  "-DGMOCK_ROOT=/opt/local" to the cmake command line.
